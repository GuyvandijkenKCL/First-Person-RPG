A basic game engine prototype for a first-person dungeon crawler RPG, inspired by the *Etrian Odyssey* series.  Built using Python and Pygame, this project explores  concepts including grid-based movement, rendering a pseudo-3D perspective, and modular game logic.
This project was a personal exploration of how to structure larger Python projects and learning the fundamentals of with Pygame.
